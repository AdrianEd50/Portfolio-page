                    <h3>What I changed</h3>
                    <p>I changed small stuff like a hover state for all the CTA buttons, giving them a underline and changing the background
                        color of the buttons. Also I changed the position of the "return to homepage" buttons.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>How I changed it</h3>
                    <p>When I put a hover state for the CTA buttons I take the CTA class and put a ":hover" at the end and then I gave it a
                        "text-decoration:underline" and changed the background color to a lighter color so it would be visible that the
                        cursor where held on the CTA. On the positioning of the "return to homepage" button I changed the top to 15px to make it
                        not be so close to the top of the section, also I changed the margin so it would not be so close to the left of the
                        page.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Why I changed it</h3>
                    <p>I did the changes that I did because they would make the site look more apealing and be more functional. </p>

                    <h3>What I changed</h3>
                    <p>On this project I also changed stuff like a hover state for all the CTA buttons, giving them a underline decoration
                        and changing the background
                        color of the buttons. I added a "return to homepage" button on all the pages on this project. I also made the footer
                        thinner.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>How I changed it</h3>
                    <p>When I put a hover state for the CTA buttons I take the CTA class and put a ":hover" at the end and then I gave it a
                        "text-decoration:underline" and changed the background color to a lighter color so it would be visible that the
                        cursor where held on the CTA. On the footer I changed the padding to a lower number so it got thinner.
                    And lastly when I added the "return to homepage" buttons I just put in a link that went to the index.html and the text
                    was "return to homepage". And WHen positioning the button I changed the top to a px that made sense so it was not to
                    tihgt to the top of the section, and the margin so it was not to close to the left of the page.</p>

                    <p>I did the changes that I did because they would make the site look more apealing and be more functional. And easier
                        to go where you want to go.</p>

                    <h3>What I changed</h3>
                    <p>On the project exam 1 I did not change anything because I had not got any feedback from the tutors and what I needed
                        to make better I could not figure out how to do, just like when I did the project itself.</p>
